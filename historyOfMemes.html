                                The moment this comic was posted to Twitter, people all over was wondering if it was the comic was the first ever meme.
                            <br>
                                This caused excitement, the picture in a format-dependent joke, typically of a picture with a cation or subtitle.
                            <br>
                                the drawing in the same template/format as the 'Expectations vs. Reality' joke, in which compares both left and right pictures, side by side.
                            <br>
                                With the obvious discrepancy between the two. 
                            <br>
                        </p>
                            <h3>
                                Where does it come from?
                            </h3>
                        <p class="classicMemeSubText">
                                The comic was found in a 1921 edition of satirical magazine The Judge, published by the University of Iowa.
                            <br>
                                Within The Judge, the comic is then credited to a different magazine - the Wisconsin Octopus, published at the University of Wisconsin between 1919 and 1959.
                            <br>
                                By looking through the University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries, we were able to view a few early editions of the Wisconsin Octopus magazine, and found this is not the first time the 'Expectations vs. Reality'-format joke appeared in print.
                            <br>
                        </p>
                            <h3>
                                Is it 'The First Meme'?
                            </h3>
                        <p class="firstMemeText">
                                According to the definition, a single image cannot be a meme. It has to be copied and spread with variations to the original image.
                            <br>
                                So on its own, the 1921 comic is <u>not a meme.</u>
                            <br>    
                                But coupled with the comic from either 1919 or 1920, it begins to fit the definition, as the two comics are variations on the same style - using two panels and captions to set-up an expectation and contrast it with reality.
                            <br>
                                While we can't say with certainty that this is the first meme by that definition, we can say that because it was copied and spread with variations this cartoon was genuinely part of a pre-internet 'Expectations vs. Reality' meme.
                            <br>
                                Clearly the writers of the Wisconsin Octopus magazine were ahead of their time.
