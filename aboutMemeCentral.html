                                    It all started from a course that a certain individual took.
                                <br>    
                                    His name is Pit Dela Cruz, he took part of an awesome course from
                                    <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/" target="_blank">
                                        CodeNation.

                                <br>
                                    It was a 3 week course that taught him the basics, from JavaScript to HTML then to CSS.
                                <br>
                                    He was an IT Technician & Engineer and had no idea about coding if it was to code or to read code, there was no chance he would understand anything.
                                <br>
                                    But from doing the 3 week course he managed to code this website within a week.
                                <br>    
                                    Comes to show that even if you know nothing, with time and determination you can acomplish anything.
                                <br>
                                    Yes it was hard at the beginning for him, but patience is key. With research and help from his friends and his teacher he learnt more from his mistakes.
                                <br>
                                    Eventually he managed to code everything and put it all together, which at the end you are now viewing his end product.
